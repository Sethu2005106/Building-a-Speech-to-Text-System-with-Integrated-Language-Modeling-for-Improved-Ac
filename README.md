TOPIC :BULIDING A SPEECH TO TEXT SYSTEM WITH INTEGRATED LANGUAGE  MODELING FOR IMPROVED ACCURACY IN TRANSCRIPTION SERVICES  (unit  3)

REQUIREMENT  :
             
           Python: 3.8-3.11

           pip install  os

           pip install torch

           pip install  soundfile

           pip install  tranformers

           pip install numpy

           pip install   speech recognizer

           pip install  sounddevices

           pip install  sound file
            
           pip install transformers torch soundfile pyctcdecode

OVERVIEW:
              This project involves creating a speech recognition system that combines acoustic modeling with language modeling to improve transcription accuracy. The 
              integrated language model helps the system predict likely word sequences based on context, correcting potential errors from the acoustic model alone.

KEY FEATURES:
           Complete Pipeline:

                              Audio loading and preprocessing

                              Acoustic modeling with Wav2Vec 2.0

                              Language model integration with KenLM

                              Beam search decoding with pyctcdecode

          Flexible Configuration:

                              Can work with or without language model

                              Automatically downloads required models

                              Tunable LM parameters (alpha, beta)

         Production-Ready Structure:

                               Proper error handling

                               Progress bars for downloads

                               Clean output formatting
